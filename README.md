A keylogger, also known as keystroke logging or keyboard capturing software, is a type of software or hardware device designed to capture and record every keystroke typed on a computer keyboard. Keyloggers can operate covertly, often without the user's knowledge, and they are used for various purposes, both legitimate and malicious.
